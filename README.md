# Suplmntl

A lightweight list making, sharing, and annotation tool.

Made with NodeJS + MongoDB on the backend and a single-page webapp built with React on the frontend.

## Purpose

This was an on and off side project for about two years. It was hosted on Heroku for about 6 months but I didn't use it as much as I had hoped I would, and to be honest no one else did either.

## To Do

There are a lot of other tweaks and features I had wanted to add. Below is a short list of them:

- Server side rendering for social (Twitter, FB) cards
- Rearrange links on lists
- Fork counts
- Archive action
- Folders
- Collection pagination
